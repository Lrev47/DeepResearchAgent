## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation First (Must Complete Before Others)
1. **Environment Setup**: API keys, database configuration, authentication
2. **Basic Functionality Verification**: Ensure all template features work
3. **Core Infrastructure**: Database schema, user management, session handling

### Iterative Development (Build Upon Each Other)
1. **UI/UX Foundation**: Custom branding, responsive design, navigation
2. **Chat Enhancement**: Professional assistant, conversation history
3. **Research Core**: Search integration, citation tracking, basic agents
4. **Advanced Features**: Agent orchestration, document processing, reports
5. **Production Polish**: Monitoring, optimization, error handling

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Frontend UI improvements can happen alongside backend API development
- Research agent development can happen in parallel with document processing
- Monitoring and analytics can be added throughout development

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Vector database performance at scale
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing, caching, and query optimization

- **Risk**: API rate limiting affecting user experience
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent rate limiting, caching, and fallback strategies

- **Risk**: Complex agent workflows causing reliability issues
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple agents, add complexity gradually, implement monitoring

### MVP Strategy
- Focus on core research functionality first (chat + search + citations)
- Ensure basic user flows work reliably before adding advanced features
- Prioritize user feedback and iterate based on actual usage patterns

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: AI API costs scaling with usage
- **Mitigation**: Implement usage monitoring, intelligent caching, and cost controls
